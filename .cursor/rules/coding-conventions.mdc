# Coding Conventions and Patterns

## Component Structure

Components should follow these patterns as demonstrated in [NotesLibrary.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/content/components/NotesLibrary.tsx):

1. Import order:
   - React and hooks
   - Third-party libraries and icons
   - Local stores and types
   - Other local imports

2. Component organization:
   - State declarations
   - Helper functions
   - Early returns for empty/error states
   - Main render logic

## Theme Implementation

Theme-related styling should:
- Use the global theme store
- Implement transitions with `transition-colors duration-300`
- Provide both dark and light mode colors
- Use consistent color variables

## TypeScript Usage

- Use TypeScript types for component props and store state
- Import types separately when possible
- Define interfaces/types close to where they're used

## State Management

- Use custom stores for global state
- Keep component state local when possible
- Use appropriate React hooks for state management
- Implement proper state updates with immutable patterns
