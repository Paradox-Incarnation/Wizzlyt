# Teach Website - Separate Application

## Overview

The `entrypoints/teach/` directory contains a **completely separate website** that should be treated as an independent application from the main browser extension project.

## Key Characteristics

- **Standalone Website**: The teach folder is NOT part of the browser extension
- **Independent Entry Point**: Has its own [index.html](mdc:entrypoints/teach/index.html), [main.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/teach/main.tsx), and [App.tsx](mdc:entrypoints/teach/App.tsx)
- **Separate Styling**: Uses its own [style.css](mdc:entrypoints/teach/style.css) with Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
- **Different Purpose**: Serves a different function than the browser extension

## Development Approach

When working with the teach folder:
- Treat it as a completely separate React application
- Don't assume it shares state, components, or functionality with the main extension
- Consider it has its own build process and deployment pipeline
- Apply web development best practices as if it were a standalone project

## File Structure

```
entrypoints/teach/
├── index.html      # HTML entry point
├── main.tsx        # React application bootstrap
├── App.tsx         # Main React component
└── style.css       # Tailwind + DaisyUI styling
```

## Important Notes

- This is NOT a browser extension component
- This is NOT related to the content scripts or extension settings
- This should be developed and maintained separately from the main extension codebase
- Changes here don't affect the browser extension functionality
