Function calling involves a structured interaction between your application, the model, and external functions. Here's a breakdown of the process:

Define Function Declaration: Define the function declaration in your application code. Function Declarations describe the function's name, parameters, and purpose to the model.
Call LLM with function declarations: Send user prompt along with the function declaration(s) to the model. It analyzes the request and determines if a function call would be helpful. If so, it responds with a structured JSON object.
Execute Function Code (Your Responsibility): The Model does not execute the function itself. It's your application's responsibility to process the response and check for Function Call, if
Yes: Extract the name and args of the function and execute the corresponding function in your application.
No: The model has provided a direct text response to the prompt (this flow is less emphasized in the example but is a possible outcome).
Create User friendly response: If a function was executed, capture the result and send it back to the model in a subsequent turn of the conversation. It will use the result to generate a final, user-friendly response that incorporates the information from the function call.
This process can be repeated over multiple turns, allowing for complex interactions and workflows. The model also supports calling multiple functions in a single turn (parallel function calling) and in sequence (compositional function calling).

Step 1: Define Function Declaration
Define a function and its declaration within your application code that allows users to set light values and make an API request. This function could call external services or APIs.

Python
JavaScript

import { Type } from '@google/genai';

// Define a function that the model can call to control smart lights
const setLightValuesFunctionDeclaration = {
  name: 'set_light_values',
  description: 'Sets the brightness and color temperature of a light.',
  parameters: {
    type: Type.OBJECT,
    properties: {
      brightness: {
        type: Type.NUMBER,
        description: 'Light level from 0 to 100. Zero is off and 100 is full brightness',
      },
      color_temp: {
        type: Type.STRING,
        enum: ['daylight', 'cool', 'warm'],
        description: 'Color temperature of the light fixture, which can be `daylight`, `cool` or `warm`.',
      },
    },
    required: ['brightness', 'color_temp'],
  },
};

/**
* Set the brightness and color temperature of a room light. (mock API)
* @param {number} brightness - Light level from 0 to 100. Zero is off and 100 is full brightness
* @param {string} color_temp - Color temperature of the light fixture, which can be `daylight`, `cool` or `warm`.
* @return {Object} A dictionary containing the set brightness and color temperature.
*/
function setLightValues(brightness, color_temp) {
  return {
    brightness: brightness,
    colorTemperature: color_temp
  };
}
Step 2: Call the model with function declarations
Once you have defined your function declarations, you can prompt the model to use the function. It analyzes the prompt and function declarations and decides to respond directly or to call a function. If a function is called the response object will contain a function call suggestion.

Python
JavaScript

import { GoogleGenAI } from '@google/genai';

// Generation Config with Function Declaration
const config = {
  tools: [{
    functionDeclarations: [setLightValuesFunctionDeclaration]
  }]
};

// Configure the client
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ apiKey: process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY });

// Define user prompt
const contents = [
  {
    role: 'user',
    parts: [{ text: 'Turn the lights down to a romantic level' }]
  }
];

// Send request with function declarations
const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents: contents,
  config: config
});

console.log(response.functionCalls[0]); 
The model then returns a functionCall object in an OpenAPI compatible schema specifying how to call one or more of the declared functions in order to respond to the user's question.

Python
JavaScript

{
  name: 'set_light_values',
  args: { brightness: 25, color_temp: 'warm' }
}
Step 3: Execute set_light_values function code
Extract the function call details from the model's response, parse the arguments , and execute the set_light_values function in our code.

Python
JavaScript

// Extract tool call details
const tool_call = response.functionCalls[0]

let result;
if (tool_call.name === 'set_light_values') {
  result = setLightValues(tool_call.args.brightness, tool_call.args.color_temp);
  console.log(`Function execution result: ${JSON.stringify(result)}`);
}
Step 4: Create User friendly response with function result and call the model again
Finally, send the result of the function execution back to the model so it can incorporate this information into its final response to the user.

Python
JavaScript

// Create a function response part
const function_response_part = {
  name: tool_call.name,
  response: { result }
}

// Append function call and result of the function execution to contents
contents.push({ role: 'model', parts: [{ functionCall: tool_call }] });
contents.push({ role: 'user', parts: [{ functionResponse: function_response_part }] });

// Get the final response from the model
const final_response = await ai.models.generateContent({
  model: 'gemini-2.0-flash',
  contents: contents,
  config: config
});

console.log(final_response.text);
This completes the function calling flow. The Model successfully used the set_light_values function to perform the request action of the user.

Function declarations
When you implement function calling in a prompt, you create a tools object, which contains one or more function declarations. You define functions using JSON, specifically with a select subset of the OpenAPI schema format. A single function declaration can include the following parameters:

name (string): A unique name for the function (get_weather_forecast, send_email). Use descriptive names without spaces or special characters (use underscores or camelCase).
description (string): A clear and detailed explanation of the function's purpose and capabilities. This is crucial for the model to understand when to use the function. Be specific and provide examples if helpful ("Finds theaters based on location and optionally movie title which is currently playing in theaters.").
parameters (object): Defines the input parameters the function expects.
type (string): Specifies the overall data type, such as object.
properties (object): Lists individual parameters, each with:
type (string): The data type of the parameter, such as string, integer, boolean, array.
description (string): A description of the parameter's purpose and format. Provide examples and constraints ("The city and state, e.g., 'San Francisco, CA' or a zip code e.g., '95616'.").
enum (array, optional): If the parameter values are from a fixed set, use "enum" to list the allowed values instead of just describing them in the description. This improves accuracy ("enum": ["daylight", "cool", "warm"]).
required (array): An array of strings listing the parameter names that are mandatory for the function to operate.
