# Extension Configuration Management

## Settings Page Architecture

The settings page serves as the configuration hub for the extension:
- Implemented as a full webpage for better user experience
- Provides comprehensive note management interface
- Handles extension configuration persistence

## Configuration Flow

1. Settings Storage:
   - All configuration changes are written to localStorage
   - Use consistent key names for settings
   - Include version information for potential future migrations

2. Extension Access:
   - Extension content scripts read configuration from localStorage
   - Implement proper fallbacks for missing configuration
   - Handle configuration updates without requiring extension reload

## Best Practices

- Always use typed configuration objects
- Include default values for all settings
- Implement validation for configuration values
- Use events to notify content scripts of configuration changes
- Keep configuration schema documented and versioned

## Security Considerations

- Sanitize all configuration values before use
- Don't store sensitive information in localStorage
- Validate configuration data when reading from localStorage
- Handle missing or corrupted configuration gracefully
